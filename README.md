# TicTacToe

a simple tic-tac-toe game for Arduino board.
I wrote the code with [@Burgerlein](https://github.com/Burgerlein) in college class

# how it works 
The playing field is visualized on the 4 LED matrices. The playing field can also be played on a martix, but it's not as pretty.
Information and error messages are displayed on the LCD display, such as when a field is occupied or whose turn it is.
